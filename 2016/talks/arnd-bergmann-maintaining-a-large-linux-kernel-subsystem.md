## Maintaining a large Linux kernel subsystem

### <img height = "32" src="../../../images/talk.svg"> 11:00 bis 12:00 in Raum V1 {#-1100-bis-1200-in-raum-v1}

### Arnd Bergmann

Arnd is co-maintainer for one of the largest subsystems in the linux kernel: the arm-soc tree that is used for collecting all the changes to SoC vendor specific files in the ARM architectures. He gives an overview of his work, how he deals every release with over 1000 patches and 100 pull requests from downstream maintainers, and how you can get your patches into the tree

### Vorwissen

This presentation will be in English language, and is an updated version of a talk I originally gave the embedded Linux Conference 2015
