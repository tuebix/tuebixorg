### Jonas Benn

This will be a hard one to do in 5 minutes. :D Nevertheless, here is the plan:  
— What is problematic with the current scientific publication system?  
— Short introduction to the Open Science Movement  
— Giving a little taster of "Octopus" and Chris Hartgerink's recent proposal, described in “Verified, Shared, Modular, and Provenance Based Research Communication with the Dat Protocol”

### Über mich

When I heard about the replication crisis and also the recent revelations of well-known scientists working with questionable methodology, I wondered — can we do better?
