## Forensic container checkpointing and analysis

### <img height = "32" src="../../../images/talk.svg"> 11:00 bis 11:50 in Raum V2

### Adrian Reber

With the introduction of "Forensic Container Checkpointing" in Kubernetes 1.25 it is possible to checkpoint containers. The ability to checkpoint containers opens up many new use cases. Containers can be migrated without loosing the state of the container, fast startup from existing checkpoints, using spot instances more effective. The primary use case, based on the title of the Kubernetes enhancement proposal, is the forensic analysis of the checkpointed containers. In this session I want to introduce the different possible use cases of "Forensic Container Checkpointing" with a focus on how to perform forensic analysis on the checkpointed containers. The presented use cases and especially the forensic analysis will be done as a live demo giving the audience a hands on experience.

### Über mich

Adrian is a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat and is migrating processes at least since 2010. He started to migrate processes in a high performance computing environment and at some point he migrated so many processes that he got a PhD for that. Most of the time he is now migrating containers but occasionally he still migrates single processes.
