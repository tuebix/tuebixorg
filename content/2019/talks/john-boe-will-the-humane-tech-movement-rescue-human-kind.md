### John Boe

I talked with a few people who would self-identify as followers of the "human technology movement". This movement was founded by Tristan Harris and I also watched a few talks of his. I will try to summarize the problem analysis and proposed solutions of Harris. When there is still time left, I will give a few hints why the proposed solutions seem problematic to me.
