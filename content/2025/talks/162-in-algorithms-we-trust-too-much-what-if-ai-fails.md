#### Abstract

"Some people love AI, but others fear it. Why? Is it because of its potential harm to the job market? The way it stretches the barrier between fabrication and reality? Perhaps they saw too many Terminator movies? Whatever the reason, the news media is full of stories that paint glorious pictures of AI’s potential and devastating images of its failures."

#### Beschreibung

In Algorithms We Trust - too much?}  
We believe in the power of the algorithm - the superiority of the machine over the human mind - artificial intelligence. But it doesn't even exist - it's an invention of clever marketing people, and AI is not new either, just as CYBER is not an abbreviation for cybernetics  
from the Greek. It is a theory of all dynamic systems. It deals in particular with information processing in dynamic systems and their regulation and control. Cybernetics researches the essential properties of dynamic systems so that they can process the relevant information and the systems can be steered in a targeted manner or steer themselves accordingly

and has its origins in the middle of the 20th century.
