### Alexander Berg

"Xpra is an open-source multi-platform persistent remote display server and client for forwarding applications and desktop screens. It gives you remote access to individual applications or full desktops. On X11, it is also known as screen for X11: it allows you to run programs, usually on a remote host, direct their display to your local machine, and then to disconnect from these programs and reconnect from the same or another machine, without losing any state. It can also be used to forward full desktops, from X11 servers, MS Windows, or Mac OS X."
