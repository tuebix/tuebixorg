## Investigating Checkpoint and Restore for GPU-Accelerated Containers

### <img height = "32" src="../../../images/talk.svg"> 11:30 bis 11:50 in Raum V1 (F119)

### Adrian Reber

GPUs are a costly commodity and training models is a time intensive task. In this session, we look to identify if we can leverage Checkpoint and Restore with containers on GPUs. Given the nascency of this technology, this is an exploratory session sharing the findings of early investigations and proof-of-concepts. We will go over the functionalities that currently exist along with gaps in the ecosystem to enable this solution.

### Ãœber mich

Adrian is a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat and is migrating processes at least since 2010. He started to migrate processes in a high performance computing environment and at some point he migrated so many processes that he got a PhD for that. Most of the time he is now migrating containers but occasionally he still migrates single processes.
