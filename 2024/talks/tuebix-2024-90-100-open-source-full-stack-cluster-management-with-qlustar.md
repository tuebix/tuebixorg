## 100% Open Source Full Stack Cluster Management with Qlustar

### <img height = "32" src="../../../images/talk.svg"> 15:00 bis 15:50 in Raum V1 (F119)

### Roland Fehrenbacher

Setting up and operating HPC, AI or storage clusters remains a  
challenge. Individual software packages are freely available for many  
areas, however an integrated open-source solution covering all aspects  
of cluster management is needed to handle the ever growing complexity.  
As a mature Cluster OS, Qlustar fills this gap. It includes scalable  
boot/image technology coupled with powerful management software to  
allow precise configuration of cluster components as well as their  
efficient operation.

This presentation will give an introductory overview of Qlustar and  
its use cases. Special focus is put on the new dramatically  
simplified Qlustar HA stack that allows to set up highly-available  
clusters with much less effort than traditional solutions.
